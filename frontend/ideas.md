## ideas / brainstorming session:
- [ ] market = galaxy/map/systems/whatever wherew you can explore planets<br>
- [ ] unlock planets at levels, your dc role = best planet<br>
- [ ] start on earth, then you unlock mars, then venus, then so on so on<br>
- [ ] planets are packs that you can go on expedetions on.<br>
- [ ] loosely fit with blooket theme<br>
- [ ] no infinite money<br>
- [ ] LOTS of stats to create competition<br>
- [ ] users start off with some coins to make the game welcoming (1.5k atm)<br>
- [ ] daily rewards wheel?<br>
- [ ] BALANCED FOR NEW USERS<br>
- [ ] minigame ideas: exploration, combat (brawl), mining<br>
- [ ] 2-4 server process (that also have mysql pools with the connection limit is 5) that split requests across eachother<br>
### NOTE
dont change blooket gameplay loop, just add onto it.<br>
we are loosely doing blooket basically.
